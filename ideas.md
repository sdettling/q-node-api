Multiple winner
(single transferable vote)

Single winner
(first past the post, pularity)
(instant runoff, majority)
(schulze method)

Single or Multiple
(tally)
(borda count, (higher ranks get more points))



single transferable vote
rank em all
votes needed to win = (valid votes cast / (seats to fill + 1)) + 1
when a choice meets the quota it wins, it's extra value goes to second choices...


borda count - basically what we're currently doing
top vote is worth points equal to total choices
all rank spots should be filled in each vote for maximum fairness


First past the post
1 vote per person, choice with most votes wins - leads to 2 party system

alternative vote, instant runoff
rank as many as you want

condorcet schulze
check each 1 on 1 race, the one that beat all the others is the winner


Alright - 
Voting method is the same for every question:
You rank your shit - rank only the ones you want, you can rank some equally, leave some out.

Question creator tells us how many "seats to fill"
If 1 winner use alternate vote or condorcet
If > 1 winner use borda count or stv
